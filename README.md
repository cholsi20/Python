# Python
Programs written in Python for Intro to Python course.

A collection of programs written in Python as solutions for Introduction to Programming Using Python by Y. Daniel Liang. These programs were written by me without the help of any study guides, solution's manuals, or other aids.
This is a collection of my work written in solution to very specific questions within the book and not
intended for use as a study guide.

While I can say that all these programs work to meet the criteria of the question, I do not guarentee their safety of efficacy outside of their indended purpose should you shoose to run them.

This collection of programs is not intended to infringe on any copyright or to act as a solution guide to future students. The purpose of this collection is to serve as an example of my work and how I think through an question.

Thank you.
